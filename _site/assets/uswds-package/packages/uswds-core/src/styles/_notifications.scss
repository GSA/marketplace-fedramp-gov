+ "\A - Accessibility: We added `type='button'` to all buttons that"

+ "\A   need `type='button'`."
+ "\A - Accessibility: We updated the markup in the usa-password package"
+ "\A   to use a <button> element instead of an anchor element."
+ "\A - Accessibility: Elements that get `aria-disabled` instead of"
+ "\A   `disabled` are now styled as disabled."
+ "\A - Compatibility: We're using some CSS selectors not supported"
+ "\A   by IE11."
+ "\A - Deprecated: We deprecated the embed-container() mixin."

+ "\A - Settings: We changed the default value of $theme-hero-image."

+ "\A --------------------------------------------------------------------"
+ "\A 3.2.0"
+ "\A - Accessibility: We changed `div.usa-identifier__identity` to "
+ "\A   `section.usa-identifier__identity` (we changed the div to a "
+ "\A   section) so the ARIA label is associated with an non-div element."
+ "\A - Accessibility: We updated the aria-label in English versions of"
+ "\A   section.usa-banner to 'Official website of the United States "
+ "\A   government' to reduce ambiguity in screen reader vocalizations. "
+ "\A   Previously, 'An official' could be misunderstood as 'unofficial'."
+ "\A - Accessibility: We added `aria-hidden='true'` to the parent div "
+ "\A   of `p.usa-banner__header-text` in usa-banner. We also "
+ "\A   removed `aria-hidden='true'` from `p.usa-banner__header-action`. "
+ "\A   Together these assure that the proper elements are read in the"
+ "\A   banner."
+ "\A - Accessibility: In the lock icon SVG in usa-banner, we changed the "
+ "\A   value of aria-labelledby to  "
+ "\A   `aria-labelledby='banner-lock-description'` and updated the value"
+ "\A   of desc#banner-lock-description to `'Locked padlock'` to simplify"
+ "\A   the vocalization."
+ "\A - Accessibility: We added `aria-hidden='true' to "
+ "\A   `img.usa-banner__header-flag` in usa-banner since this is a"
