/*  deprecated.scss
    ---
    Occasionally the design system will deprecate
    old variables or functionality. If we replace
    the old functionality with something new, this is a
    place to connect the old functionality to the
    new functionality, in the service of better
    continuity and backwards compatibility within a
    major release cycle.

    Note the USWDS version where we deprecated the
    old functionality in a comment.

    Be sure to update notifications.scss.

    This file should started fresh at each
    major version.
